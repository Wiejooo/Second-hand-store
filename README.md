# Second-hand-store
This is Django aplication for selling clothing. The user can sell and buy unused garments.<br>

THIS IS NOT FINISHED APP. WORKING IN PROGRESS.
The site doesn't have the style side done yet. For now is raw.<br>

## User
The user can register by completing the fields: Username, Email, Password, Password confirmation. After that, he can login.
User can enter to his profile and see his personal data and his offerts. In addition, there is the possibility, to change the password (for now only if the user remembers the old password).
The logout function also works well.
